# Task 2
# Feature Engineering and Selection:

1. **Car Age Calculation:**
   - Determining the age of the car allows us to better understand its depreciation, which is critical for price prediction.

2. **Mileage Per Year:**
   - This feature provides information about the car's usage intensity. A car that has a high mileage in a short period of time may depreciate faster.

# Data Augmentation:

3. **Synthetic Data Generation:**
   - Enhancing the dataset by creating synthetic variations can help improve model robustness and generalization.

# Feature Selection:

4. **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFECV):**
   - RFECV aids in selecting the most relevant features while preventing noise from distracting the model.

# Cross-validation:

5. **Stratified K-Fold:**
   - This ensures that each fold is a good representation of the entire dataset, resulting in a more robust model evaluation.

# Hyperparameter Tuning:

6. **Bayesian Optimization:**
   - Using Bayesian Optimization is a more efficient hyperparameter tuning method that finds the best parameters faster than traditional grid or random search methods.

# Ensemble Methods:

7. **Gradient Boosting with Early Stopping:**
   - Gradient Boosting constructs trees sequentially, correcting errors from previous trees. By halting training when performance reaches a plateau, early stopping ensures that the model does not overfit.

# Model Evaluation:

8. **RMSE and MAE Metrics:**
   - These metrics provide a quantitative measure of model errors, aiding in understanding the accuracy of predictions.

9. **Visualization of Feature Importance:**
   - By visualizing which features contribute the most, we can focus on gathering quality data for those features in the future.


# Model Comparison:

**Old Model (Model 1):**
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 4537.93
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 3281.50

**New Model (Model 2):**
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 3265.65
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 2315.96

In comparison to Model 1, Model 2 has a lower RMSE and MAE. As a result of these metrics, Model 2 outperforms Model 1 in terms of prediction accuracy.

# Recommendations for Future Work:

1. **Regularization Techniques:**
   - Consider both L1 and L2 regularization or dropout methods to reduce overfitting.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Ensure a clean dataset, free of outliers and missing values, to improve model performance significantly.

3. **Advanced Feature Engineering:**
   - Explore interaction terms or polynomial features, which may be more effective at capturing non-linear relationships.

4. **Model Stacking:**
   - Implement model stacking, a technique that combines predictions from multiple models to produce more accurate results.

5. **Deep Learning:**
   - Explore the potential of neural networks for capturing complex patterns more effectively in large datasets.
